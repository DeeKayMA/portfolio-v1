# diquan.net — Portfolio v1 🌐  
[Live Site](https://www.diquan.net)

This is my personal portfolio site — a visual playground and digital home for my work as a front-end developer, creative technologist, and product-minded indie hacker. Built from scratch with React and deployed on Netlify, it reflects my design-forward style and obsession with craft.

## 🧠 About

I'm Diquan — I build clean, creative interfaces and tools that balance function and form. This site features selected projects, links to my experiments, and a little about me.

I take inspiration from minilamist web design, modern aesthetics, and bold layout systems — all expressed with code. This portfolio is designed to be minimalist but characterful, showcasing my capabilities without saying too much.
